Reflection:
In a project on student dropout prediction, I ensured fairness by anonymizing features and using balanced sampling. 
Going forward, I will implement SHAP for interpretability and involve affected stakeholders.

Bonus - Ethical AI in Healthcare Policy:
1. Consent: Get informed patient consent, with opt-out options.
2. Bias Mitigation: Use representative data, audit regularly.
3. Transparency: Explain decisions, publish model risks, and data sources.
